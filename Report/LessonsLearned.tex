\section{Lessons Learned}

\begin{itemize}

\item Engineering is a demanding discipline. Every step of the process demands clear focus from the individual, good time management, and clear communication among peers and others in the hierarchy. If you have any reason to suspect you might have some handicap, like ADHD, get evaluated and, if appropriate, get medicated. There is no reason to hold yourself back or "fight through it" when help is available. Same goes for any other mental conditions. As wonderful as the world is, it's also full of evil and it often takes a professional to help keep your mind and spirit sharp. 

The greatest risk this project experienced was falling behind schedule due to lead author's unmedicated ADHD. The project was scheduled while it was lead author's hyperfixation, then that hyperfixation changed overnight and progress nearly ground to a halt. The presence of ADHD had been communicated at the start, but the risk to schedule had not been properly communicated/no plan had been put in place to mitigate it. Future schedule risk mitigation plans may include more detailed planning (and refining the plan as the project progresses) and more pair programming/knowledge transfer.

\item Pair programming was a highly effective teaching tool.
