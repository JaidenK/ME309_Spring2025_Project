The lead author Jaiden would like to thank his co-authors for their support, their interest in learning, and their willingness to try obnoxious new things like \LaTeX and GitHub. We would all like to thank Dr. Maya Pishvar for the opportunity to develop our skills performing Numerical Analysis of Engineering Systems.
