\paragraph{Abstract} We have developed a model of a ballistic projectile experiencing linear aerodynamic drag. This model is fit to real data of a projectile with a parachute. We compare the linear drag model against a simple parabolic model and numeric differentiation techniques to show how it provides better impact location estimations.
