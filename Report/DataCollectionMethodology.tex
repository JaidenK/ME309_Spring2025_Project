\section{Data Collection}
	Our data collection procedure was rather simple as increasing the complexity for this section would introduce more potential sources of error. We first found a location with good lighting and a consistent background, the location that we chose was one of the racquetball courts on campus. 
	Next using a tripod we set up our camera making sure to have a clear view of the projectiles trajectory ensuring that that the projectile was always in frame. This was done so that tracker (I think this is the right software) could extract the data points modeling the projectiles path. Once this was completed multiple trials were attempted being as consistent as possible. 
	In order to incorporate variable drag multiple chute designs were implemented. This was completed so that we could test the viability of our codes ability to model drag and its effect on trajectory.
