\section{Conclusion}

We ask the reader to allow themselves to be overwhelmed by joy and fascination at the thought of all the wonderful things are possible when using modern computing hardware to perform Numerical Analysis of Engineering Systems. 

In this report, we've presented the journey of 5 students honing their skills in the craft of modeling our world. As we had no illusion that we would perform groundbreaking research as part of coursework, we placed more emphasis on the overall process rather than exactly what system was being modeled. 

We leveraged our knowledge of the mechanical principles underlying our system to develop a model that allowed us to see through the noise in our observed data. 

The ability to predict the future, a skill which sounds like pure magic, is now in the palm of our hands. This can be applied to a wide variety engineering disciplines. The process we've engaged in here shall act as a foundation for our future engineering work.
